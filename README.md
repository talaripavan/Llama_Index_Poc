# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

This repository is all about RAG, a technique that's like having a super-powered search engine for your company's data. Imagine a personalized ChatGPT, but instead of chatting about anything, it helps you find and use the specific knowledge you need â€“ fast!

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation to provide coherent and contextually relevant responses. This is particularly useful for applications such as chatbots, customer service automation, and more.

## Repository Contents

- **chat_engine.py**: A basic POC (Proof of Concept) for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
  
- **chat_with_docs.py**: A POC for a RAG pipeline with a Streamlit interface, allowing interactive document retrieval and generation.
  
- **colbert_re-ranker.py**: This script acts as a "smart filter" for document retrieval. It retrieves potentially relevant documents based on a user's query and then uses ColBERT, a state-of-the-art contextual embedding technique, to re-rank these documents. This re-ranking ensures that the most relevant and informative documents are presented to the Large Language Model (LLM) for further processing.
  
- **flag_embedding_re-ranker.py**:Similar to colbert_re-ranker.py, this script retrieves relevant documents for a user query. It then employs FLAG embeddings, another advanced embedding method, to re-rank the documents in order of their relevance and usefulness for the LLM. This approach helps to prioritize the most valuable information for the LLM to work with.
  
- **milvus_hybrid_search.py**: This script takes a different approach to document retrieval. It utilizes a hybrid vector search method, combining multiple search techniques to find the most relevant documents. Once retrieved, the script doesn't re-rank them individually. Instead, it likely provides a ranked list of documents directly to the LLM for further processing. This approach could be ideal for situations where the initial retrieval is highly accurate.

- **sentence_transformer_rerank.py**:This script mirrors the functionality of colbert_re-ranker.py in many ways. It retrieves potentially relevant documents for a user query and then uses Sentence Transformers, a powerful technique for semantic similarity analysis, to re-rank these documents. By prioritizing documents with the closest semantic match to the query, this script ensures the LLM receives the most contextually relevant information for its tasks.
