The COVID-19 pandemic and e\ufb00orts to control its spread have a\ufb00ected how we and our\ncustomers, partners and suppliers are opera\u0000ng our businesses. Our opera\u0000ons have been and may in the future be nega\u0000vely a\ufb00ected by a range of external\nfactors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement\npreventa\u0000ve measures to contain or control further spread of the virus, such as travel restric\u0000ons, prohibi\u0000ons of non-essen\u0000al ac\u0000vi\u0000es, quaran\u0000nes, work-\nfrom-home direc\u0000ves and shelter-in-place/social distancing orders. These preventa\u0000ve measures led to sharp reduc\u0000ons in demand in certain industries in\nwhich our customers operate. It is not clear what long-term e\ufb00ects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, including the e\ufb00ects on our customers,\npartners, suppliers and prospects. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic e\ufb00ec\u0000vely, our business will be harmed.\nWe are a U.S. federal government contractor and are therefore subject to a federal execu\u0000ve order requiring our U.S.-based employees to be vaccinated\nunless they qualify for medical or religious exemp\u0000ons. The execu\u0000ve order has been challenged in court and has been enjoined from enforcement, but its\nul\u0000mate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely a\ufb00ect our\nworkforce reten\u0000on and hiring. In addi\u0000on, customer vaccina\u0000on requirements, as well as certain state and local vaccina\u0000on mandates, may impact our\nsta\ufb03ng abili\u0000es.\nThe nega\u0000ve impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our customers\u2019 business opera\u0000ons and their\ndemand for our products will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Addi\u0000onal impacts and risks that we are\nnot currently aware of may arise. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, partners, suppliers and other\npartners, but a material e\ufb00ect on these par\u0000es could also materially and adversely a\ufb00ect us. In addi\u0000on, we have curtailed travel expenses since the beginning\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, and it may become necessary for us to increase such travel expenses prospec\u0000vely in furtherance of our business ini\u0000a\u0000ves. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors sec\u0000on.\nData Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers\u2019 data or our IT systems are accessed\nimproperly, made unavailable, or improperly modi\ufb01ed, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputa\u0000on could be\ndamaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, any of which could\nreduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory ac\u0000ons.   Our products and services, including Oracle\nCloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers\u2019 informa\u0000on and data, as well as our own data. We believe\nthat Oracle in par\u0000cular is a target for computer hackers and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes"
